Coming from operations and customer service, I'm now stepping into data analytics. I’m passionate about making data work for people—ensuring insights are not just accurate, but also inclusive and meaningful. I care about diversity, visibility, and fair representation in the data world. Also, I no longer cry in Python, which is a win!
