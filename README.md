### Project Overview
This comprehensive Power BI dashboard, transforms complex global gender inequality data into an accessible, action-oriented visualization tool. The project spans seven interconnected sections, each revealing critical insights about women's rights worldwide.

#### Detailed Section Analysis
1. Overview Page
The executive summary presents key global statistics that immediately highlight the scope of gender inequality:
- Population Distribution: Near-equal global distribution (49.89% female vs 50.11% male) masks underlying disparities
- Economic Leadership: Only 19.25% of firms have female top managers, revealing significant glass ceiling effects
- Wage Inequality: 26.60% gender wage gap demonstrates persistent economic discrimination
- Marriage Patterns: 3.52-year gender gap in mean age at first marriage reflects cultural and social inequalities

2. Demographics & Education
- Educational Achievement: Women actually have 0.58 more years of schooling than men globally, showing positive educational trends
- Life Expectancy: Women live 5.29 years longer (75.49 vs 70.20 years), though this may reflect healthcare access differences
- Rural Populations: 39.08% of global population lives in rural areas, where gender gaps are often more pronounced
- Development Indices: Gender Development Index (0.95) and Human Development Indices (Female: 0.71, Male: 0.74) show ongoing disparities
- The section includes detailed charts showing educational attainment by country and fertility rates, with countries like Somalia, Chad, and Niger showing the highest fertility rates.

3. Legal Rights & Protection
- Political Leadership: Women hold only 23.96% of ministerial positions and 25.32% of parliamentary seats globally
- Legal Marriage Ages: Show gender disparities
- Voting Rights: Historical data shows progressive countries like New Zealand (1893) and Australia (1902) led women's suffrage
- International Commitments: Countries took varying years to ratify CEDAW, with Afghanistan taking 23 years
- The section includes detailed tables showing the evolution of women's legal rights across countries.

4. Economic Empowerment
- Wage Disparities: Women earn $1.13K average monthly wage vs men's $1.42K, creating a 26.60% gap
- Labor Force Participation: Only 50.89% of women participate vs 70.54% of men
- Leadership Representation: Men dominate firm leadership (80.75% vs 19.25% women)
- Unpaid Work: Women spend significantly more time on unpaid domestic and care work across all countries
- The section features detailed wage comparisons by country, with Monaco showing the highest wages but persistent gender gaps.

5. Health & Wellbeing
- Health indicators reveal critical gender-specific challenges:
- Maternal Health: 22.92K maternal deaths globally, with significant variations by country
- Contraceptive Access: Only 40.38% of married women use modern contraceptives
- Mental Health: Suicide rates show higher male mortality (14.68 vs 4.35 per 100k)
- Life Expectancy Gap: Women live longer in most countries, with Ukraine showing the largest gap (13.22 years)
- The section includes detailed maternal mortality data, with South Sudan, Chad, and Nigeria showing the highest rates.

6. Gender-Based Violence
- Perhaps the most disturbing section reveals widespread violence:
- Intimate Partner Violence: 25.84% of women experience lifetime intimate partner violence
- Recent Violence: 8.44% of partnered women (15-49) experienced physical/sexual violence in the last 12 months
- Femicide: 54.13% of intimate partner homicides are female victims vs 20.93% male
- Legal Protection: Only 78.81% achievement in violence against women laws globally
- The section includes detailed violence indicators by country and a world map showing legal framework achievements.

7. From Data to Action - The concluding section transforms findings into actionable steps:
### Professional Actions:
- Advocate for gender-disaggregated data collection
- Design inclusive surveys and research methods
- Implement ethical data collection practices
- Support standardization of gender data
- Ensure intersectional analysis
- Train field researchers on gender issues
- Include women in data collection teams
### Personal Impact:
- Join organizations working on gender data
- Contribute to open-source gender data projects
- Mentor women in data science
- Support women-led data initiatives
- Foster inclusive data team environments
### Learning Resources:
- UN Women Data Hub
- World Bank Gender Data Portal
- Gender Statistics Courses
- Data Feminism Workshops
- OECD Gender Data Network
- Project Conclusion

This dashboard represents a masterful integration of data analysis, visualization, and social advocacy. It successfully:
- Reveals Systemic Inequalities: The data consistently shows women facing disadvantages across economic, political, health, and safety dimensions, despite near-equal population distribution.
- Highlights Progress Areas: Education shows positive trends, with women achieving higher schooling levels than men globally.
- Identifies Critical Gaps: Gender-based violence remains alarmingly high, with over a quarter of women experiencing intimate partner violence.
- Provides Actionable Solutions: The final section transforms data insights into concrete professional and personal actions.
- Demonstrates Visual Excellence: Clean design, appropriate color coding, and multiple visualization types enhance data comprehension.
- The project exemplifies how data visualization can serve as both a diagnostic tool for understanding social issues and a catalyst for change, making complex gender inequality data accessible and actionable for diverse audiences.
- It bridges the gap between academic research and practical application, providing a roadmap for both individual and institutional action toward gender equality




### The Effects of Alcohol Consumption and Social Factors on Student Performance

#### Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes student alcohol consumption patterns and their correlations with academic performance, social factors, and demographic variables. The project examines data from 390 students aged 15-19 to understand the complex relationships between alcohol use and various life factors.
### Key Findings
Core Statistics:
- Total Students: 390
- Age Range: 15-19 years
- Average Alcohol Consumption: 3.75 (on a scale of 1 to 5)
- Average Grade: 11.02
- Average Failures: 0.31
- Average Absences: 5.69
- 
Critical Correlations:
1. Academic Performance Impact:
- Students with 2 failures show higher alcohol consumption than those with 0 failures
- Higher alcohol consumption correlates with lower grades
- Students who don't want higher education have significantly higher alcohol consumption (4.32 vs 3.72)
  
2. Family and Social Factors:
- Students without family support show higher alcohol consumption (3.91 vs 3.65)
- Family relations quality inversely correlates with alcohol use:
- "Very Bad" relations: 4.50 average consumption
- "Excellent" relations: 3.44 average consumption
- 87% receive educational support, 67% are in romantic relationships
  
3. Study Habits and Health:
- Strong inverse correlation between study time and alcohol consumption:
- 1 hour study time: 4.48 average consumption
- 3 hours study time: 3.03 average consumption
- Health status shows mixed patterns, with "Very Good" health students having highest consumption (4.06)
  
4. Age Progression:
- Alcohol consumption generally increases with age (15-19)
- Grades tend to decline as age and alcohol consumption increase
- Dashboard Structure
- Page 1: Alcohol Consumption Analysis
- Key performance indicators
- Age vs. alcohol consumption vs. grades correlation
- Alcohol consumption by failures, education aspirations, and family support
- Detailed breakdowns by family relations, health status, and study time
  
Page 2: Other Social and Academic Factors
- Study time correlation with grades
- Educational support distribution (87% receive support)
- Romantic relationship status (67% in relationships)
- Family relations quality (76% have "Good" or "Excellent" relations)
- Health status distribution
- Family support impact on academic failures
  
####Project Significance
This dashboard effectively demonstrates how data visualization can reveal complex social patterns in student behavior. It shows that alcohol consumption is not isolated but interconnected with academic performance, family dynamics, study habits, and future aspirations. The findings suggest that interventions targeting family support, study habits, and academic engagement could potentially reduce alcohol consumption among students.
The project serves as a valuable tool for educators, counselors, and policymakers to understand risk factors and develop targeted intervention strategies for student well-being.
