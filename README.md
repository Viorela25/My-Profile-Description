<img width="1300" height="591" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/714ab7e1-d486-4e6c-b9ab-cc181910b75d" />


# Project Overview
This comprehensive Power BI dashboard, transforms complex global gender inequality data into an accessible, action-oriented visualization tool. The project spans seven interconnected sections, each revealing critical insights about women's rights worldwide.

Detailed Section Analysis
1. Overview Page
The executive summary presents key global statistics that immediately highlight the scope of gender inequality:
Population Distribution: Near-equal global distribution (49.89% female vs 50.11% male) masks underlying disparities
Economic Leadership: Only 19.25% of firms have female top managers, revealing significant glass ceiling effects
Wage Inequality: 26.60% gender wage gap demonstrates persistent economic discrimination
Marriage Patterns: 3.52-year gender gap in mean age at first marriage reflects cultural and social inequalities

2. Demographics & Education
Educational Achievement: Women actually have 0.58 more years of schooling than men globally, showing positive educational trends
Life Expectancy: Women live 5.29 years longer (75.49 vs 70.20 years), though this may reflect healthcare access differences
Rural Populations: 39.08% of global population lives in rural areas, where gender gaps are often more pronounced
Development Indices: Gender Development Index (0.95) and Human Development Indices (Female: 0.71, Male: 0.74) show ongoing disparities
The section includes detailed charts showing educational attainment by country and fertility rates, with countries like Somalia, Chad, and Niger showing the highest fertility rates.

3. Legal Rights & Protection
Political Leadership: Women hold only 23.96% of ministerial positions and 25.32% of parliamentary seats globally
Legal Marriage Ages: Show gender disparities
Voting Rights: Historical data shows progressive countries like New Zealand (1893) and Australia (1902) led women's suffrage
International Commitments: Countries took varying years to ratify CEDAW, with Afghanistan taking 23 years
The section includes detailed tables showing the evolution of women's legal rights across countries.

4. Economic Empowerment
Wage Disparities: Women earn $1.13K average monthly wage vs men's $1.42K, creating a 26.60% gap
Labor Force Participation: Only 50.89% of women participate vs 70.54% of men
Leadership Representation: Men dominate firm leadership (80.75% vs 19.25% women)
Unpaid Work: Women spend significantly more time on unpaid domestic and care work across all countries
The section features detailed wage comparisons by country, with Monaco showing the highest wages but persistent gender gaps.

5. Health & Wellbeing
Health indicators reveal critical gender-specific challenges:
Maternal Health: 22.92K maternal deaths globally, with significant variations by country
Contraceptive Access: Only 40.38% of married women use modern contraceptives
Mental Health: Suicide rates show higher male mortality (14.68 vs 4.35 per 100k)
Life Expectancy Gap: Women live longer in most countries, with Ukraine showing the largest gap (13.22 years)
The section includes detailed maternal mortality data, with South Sudan, Chad, and Nigeria showing the highest rates.

6. Gender-Based Violence
Perhaps the most disturbing section reveals widespread violence:
Intimate Partner Violence: 25.84% of women experience lifetime intimate partner violence
Recent Violence: 8.44% of partnered women (15-49) experienced physical/sexual violence in the last 12 months
Femicide: 54.13% of intimate partner homicides are female victims vs 20.93% male
Legal Protection: Only 78.81% achievement in violence against women laws globally
The section includes detailed violence indicators by country and a world map showing legal framework achievements.

7. From Data to Action
The concluding section transforms findings into actionable steps:
Professional Actions:
Advocate for gender-disaggregated data collection
Design inclusive surveys and research methods
Implement ethical data collection practices
Support standardization of gender data
Ensure intersectional analysis
Train field researchers on gender issues
Include women in data collection teams
Personal Impact:
Join organizations working on gender data
Contribute to open-source gender data projects
Mentor women in data science
Support women-led data initiatives
Foster inclusive data team environments
Learning Resources:
UN Women Data Hub
World Bank Gender Data Portal
Gender Statistics Courses
Data Feminism Workshops
OECD Gender Data Network
Project Conclusion

This dashboard represents a masterful integration of data analysis, visualization, and social advocacy. It successfully:
    *Reveals Systemic Inequalities: The data consistently shows women facing disadvantages across economic, political, health, and safety dimensions, despite near-equal population distribution.
     *Highlights Progress Areas: Education shows positive trends, with women achieving higher schooling levels than men globally.
Identifies Critical Gaps: Gender-based violence remains alarmingly high, with over a quarter of women experiencing intimate partner violence.
Provides Actionable Solutions: The final section transforms data insights into concrete professional and personal actions.
Demonstrates Visual Excellence: Clean design, appropriate color coding, and multiple visualization types enhance data comprehension.
The project exemplifies how data visualization can serve as both a diagnostic tool for understanding social issues and a catalyst for change, making complex gender inequality data accessible and actionable for diverse audiences. It bridges the gap between academic research and practical application, providing a roadmap for both individual and institutional action toward gender equality
